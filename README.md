# Azure Data Engineering End-To-End Project

## Project Summary
This project outlines the implementation of a complete data engineering pipeline using Azureâ€™s cloud services. The pipeline integrates Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake, Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Apache Spark to process, transform, and analyze large-scale data efficiently. 

## Project Architecture
The pipeline consists of three distinct layers for seamless data processing:

1. **Bronze Layer:** Handles raw data ingestion and stores it in Azure Data Lake.
2. **Silver Layer:** Cleans and transforms the ingested data into a structured format.
3. **Gold Layer:** Aggregates and optimizes data for advanced analytics and reporting.

This modular architecture ensures data quality and facilitates scalable data processing workflows.

## Technologies Used
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF):** Automation and orchestration of data workflows.
- **Azure Data Lake:** Storage of raw, processed, and transformed data.
- **Databricks (PySpark):** Data integration, transformation, and real-time processing.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics:** Advanced data warehousing and analytics platform.
- **Apache Spark:** Distributed data processing for big data solutions.

## Pipeline Workflow
The project workflow is divided into three phases:

### Phase 1: Bronze Layer
- Ingest raw data from multiple sources into Azure Data Lake.
- Store raw data in its original format to preserve data integrity.
- Automate data ingestion with Azure Data Factory pipelines.

### Phase 2: Silver Layer
- Process raw data to remove duplicates and standardize formats.
- Use Databricks and PySpark for efficient data transformation.
- Save the cleaned data into the Silver layer of Azure Data Lake for downstream processing.

### Phase 3: Gold Layer
- Perform data aggregation and optimize datasets for analysis.
- Load the processed data into Azure Synapse Analytics for querying and visualization.
- Leverage tools like Power BI or Synapse Studio for advanced analytics and reporting.

## Key Takeaways
- Designing modular and efficient data pipelines using Azure services.
- Applying best practices for big data processing and real-time analytics.
- Implementing robust data transformation workflows with PySpark and Databricks.
- Building scalable data warehousing solutions with Azure Synapse Analytics.
